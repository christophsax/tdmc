# tdmc

Reproducible Monte-Carlo Evaluation of Regression-Based Temporal Disaggregation
Methods.

This R package contains all *data*, *code* and *content* to build the 
paper. Requires R and LaTeX, which are both free and open source.

To install, including all required R packages:

```r
# install.packages("devtools")   # if not installed
devtools::install_github("christophsax/tdmc")
```

To run the simulations (set `n.draws = 1000` to replicate the results in the
paper. This will take about 2 hours on a modern laptop.):

```r
library(tdmc)
out_path <- system.file(package = "tdmc", "out")
sim_ar1(n.draws = 10, out_path = out_path) 
sim_sarima(n.draws = 10, out_path = out_path) 
```

To build the paper:

```r
setwd(out_path)
library(knitr)
knit2pdf(system.file(package = "tdmc", "tex", "document.Rnw"))
```

To view the paper:
```r
browseURL("document.pdf")
```
